### Brief description of identified problem / task

Shortcuts and key sequences are different across platforms (ex: emacs & vim). It can be confusing to know what keystrokes to use and what they will do without having to search for the commands. This also applies to common commands when using high level languages (ex: read, write, how to type primitive types). By visualizing the outcomes, or recording the keystrokes, it may be possible to reduce occurrences of students falling behind when lost after missing an instructional step.

### Revised Proposal

Shortcuts and key sequences for similar actions are different across text-editors. For example, if someone was trying to save and exit an emacs document, the command would be “Ctrl + x” followed by “Ctrl + s'' to save, and then “Ctrl + x” followed by “Ctrl + c” to close the document. The same result can be done on the vim editor by inputting the commands “Esc'' followed by typing “:wq” and hitting “Enter” to save and quit.

 

Of course, vim and emacs are just 2 options. There are many other text editors with different commands for similar results. For example, nano requires the user to input “Ctrl + o” and “Enter” to save, followed by “Ctrl + x” to exit. 

 

In a given classroom, virtual or in person, in which students are following along with a teacher’s coding instructions, there are often times in where the teacher saves and exits from a text editor using a command string that is obvious to themselves but may not be obvious to a given student who is unfamiliar to said editor. This may lead to students falling behind on the lesson and in turn becoming more worried on how to follow along as opposed to the material attempting to be taught. 

 

We hope to focus on this problem in order to facilitate better understanding and less distraction for both student and instructor. More specifically, we hope to hone in on and make more transparent the editor specific commands which result in some end behavior. This behavior can be both simple, like saving and exiting the editor, or more complex like switching between buffers (emacs command “Ctrl + x” then “o”) or opening 2 buffers (emacs command “Ctrl + x” then “2”).

 

There are many factors which contribute to this problem. Information recall is perhaps the biggest factor contributing to this problem in that there are many commands for specific in-line text editors. For example, emacs has over 40 common commands. Vim on the other hand has over 50 commands. It is hard for students to recall all of these commands, slowing down the speed in which they can learn. 

 

This problem is specific to programming classes, and more prevalent in introductory programming classes in which students are still unfamiliar to editor specific commands as described in the examples above. With that in mind, the stakeholders for this problem are both the students in question as well as the instructors teaching the material. Students benefit from a clearer understanding of the instructor’s actions and commands. Additionally, instructors benefit from a solution to this problem since they would have less need to pause instruction to explain or answer how they performed a specific action.

 

This problem is not entirely unique to face-to-face instruction, since often for programming courses, the instructor’s screen is projected onto a display showing the text editor itself. An approach that is mirrored in virtual instruction via screen sharing. However, we believe a solution to this problem will, in turn, benefit both forms of instruction due to the coupling of how the instruction is given via shared screen in some form (screen-share or projection).
