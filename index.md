## Synopsis 

In a given classroom, virtual or in person, in which students are following along with a teacher’s coding instructions, there are often times in where the teacher saves and exits from a command-line text editor, like Vim or Emacs, using a command string that is obvious to themselves but may not be obvious to a given student who is unfamiliar to said editor. 

Unfortunately, due to the traditional convention of command-line text editors, there is an apparent lack of affordances, what the commands may do, and signifiers, what the commands can do. This may lead to students falling behind on the lesson and in turn becoming more worried on how to follow along as opposed to the material attempting to be taught. 
This is the problem that we hope to solve. More concretely, we hope to decouple a given action within a command-line text editor and the text editor itself. This will, in turn, allow understanding of the material being taught without the prior knowledge of a specific text-editor’s encoded actions.
